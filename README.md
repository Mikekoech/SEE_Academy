# Fun Calculator ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator**! This little Python program lets you perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division â€” all while keeping things fun and simple! ðŸ˜Ž

## Features

- Input two numbers (supporting decimals).
- Calculates and displays:
  - Sum
  - Difference
  - Product
  - Quotient
- Friendly and humorous inline comments to make the code easy and enjoyable to read!

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. When prompted, enter the first number (decimals allowed).
3. Enter the second number.
4. View the results for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Note:**  
Please don't enter zero as the second number when performing division to avoid a crash (division by zero). The program assumes responsible input.

## Example

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 3

Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 13.0
Difference: 7.0
Product: 30.0
Quotient: 3.3333333333333335
```

## Code Explanation

- Uses `float()` to accept decimal numbers.
- Performs all four basic arithmetic operations.
- Prints the results clearly with emojis to keep it fun!

## Have fun calculating! ðŸ§®âœ¨
